this time i list nodes (blocks) in minetest which you maybe didnt yet met or will never met (some are normally disabled and some other are even already removed. look at nyan cat)

so yes. we go with a list, firstly we'll go with non-technical nodes (you MAYBE saw them):

- permanent fire - same as fire but can be easily deleted and placed as any other node. rest of behavior is same or similar to fire. 
[about](https://wiki.minetest.net/Permanent_Fire)

- bones - public inventory after a dead player. similar to chest.

- cave's ice - same as ice just that appears in caves so its rarer

- tnt explosion - its same as air except of that it produces light. doesnt make damage and disappears in a while being relaced by 'normal' air 
[about](https://wiki.minetest.net/Tnt:boom)

- nyan cat - behaved similar to other blocks. was removed because was too rare (easteregg. only in older minetest versions)

now we list techincal ones. practically you met all of em everytime you play but it hard to see em if your pc is fast. :

- cloud - non destroyable (only TnT). blocks moves (like wall). placeable. mostly met in sky as a decoration. visible as white/gray block.

[about](https://wiki.minetest.net/Cloud)

- air - non-destroyable node which fills empty space. invisible. probably you walk in it (if your not in no-clip mode ;p) 

[about](https://wiki.minetest.net/Air)

- unknown node - it appears when a mod didnt load properly or is broken. behaves as much it can from written node.

- ignore - yes you already met this block even not knowing. either at the ends of map or early at loading it. its an invisible wall which you cant place (usually. minetest game blocks usage of it without modifying client).
