<p>&nbsp;okay, here a smol list (all are randomly positioned, dont look at "whats first"), all are tested:</p><p><span></span></p><a name='more'></a>&nbsp;• elinks - works only in CLI. should support JS. colored version possible to enable (not by default). good in recovery mode to search how to fix problems from normal mode ;)<br /><p></p><p>• firefox - known. what to say. recently guys made this started less taking privacy at first place but for the now its not too bad choice. supports custom themes/addons, have some protections, moddable.<br /></p><p>• brave - privacy-respecting but focused on bitcoins ;-; . customizable almost as firefox/chromium. blocks ads<br /></p><p>• chromium - FOSS and degoogled version of chrome. eats same amount of ram sadly ;-; gives only more privacy (custom themes and addons possible to install)<br /></p><p>• waterfox - mix of firefox, chromium and opera. might be very laggy (MORE THAN CHROMIUM). addons and themes possible to install from any possible store of any mentioned browsers (opera, firefox, chrome). generally modded firefox with custom settings.<br /></p><p>• tor browser - most privacy respecting browser. possible to enter darknet. yes, laggy. have its own vpn, so not recommended for asians (china/korea). blocks ads, tracking and some scripts.<br /></p><p>• gnome browser - not many features (almost not themable - dark/light theme only, almost no downloadable extensions...). light and stable<br /></p><p>• eolie - unstable. likes to forget tabs and history. tab bar is reversed (on left instead of top). for theming and extensions same as gnome's cuz this one is a fork of it<br /></p><p>• opera - not private. good for games cause of features. have its own theme/extension store<br /></p><p>• falkon - very light and stable. looks best in kde. themes/extensions available, also very customizable. blocks some ads<br /></p>
