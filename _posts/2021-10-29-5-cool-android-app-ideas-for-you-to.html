<p>&nbsp;None of these apps exist, so you can take these ideas:</p><span><a name='more'></a></span><p>1) activator</p><p>for the now it exist only for jailbroken ios [in cydia, free]. App for mapping buttons, keyboard, gestures, device actions like unlocking screen. For android there exist similarities but none of them have all actions. For example - can remap keys and buttons but cant change software's behavior.</p><p>2) TWRP theme creator</p><p>There exist creators for xiaomi, huawei, samsung. Why not to theme recovery which IS themable but requires programming knowledge? Some themes are already made by devs.</p><p>3) launcher with keyboard, lockscreen, statusbar and a few preinstalled small apps</p><p>Most close to this is luutinh with their set of apps (not one) to theme android to iphone and desktop-similar big launchers like leena. Also cheetah mobile (removed from google play cuz of virused ads) also with app pack. Noone yet made one of it all...</p><p>4) music player app vault</p><p>There are calc app vaults and even one gallery. But none with music player. Isnt it easy to hide something under a sus title?</p><p>Also -&gt; google browser app vault ;)</p><p>5) phone control</p><p>There is bt-info but mostly doesnt work and is a little hackish. Same for bluetooth serial terminal. Someone already developed wireless camera but it have access to a one feature. Why not to make password-protected app where both phones need to have same app installed? Wouldnt it be good to have walkie-talkie, videos on tv, bt camera for group photos, easy file sharing and be able to find lost second phone at once?</p><p>|BONUS IDEA|</p><p>Not app but system.</p><p>Could it be good to have custom rom which acts like linux TERMINAL but under android? There are already mobile distros, android also is a distro. But smh noone yet didnt made mobile with 100% of cli? Like under arch? Hmm</p>
