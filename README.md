- if you see mirror from codeberg - go to github page to view site (theres no public ci/cd on codeberg)
- if you see it from github - link to blog [here](https://hacknorris-aka-penguin.github.io/)

based on [beautiful jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll)

contents of blog :
- few memes
